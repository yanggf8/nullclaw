# Security

NullClaw follows secure-by-default behavior: local bind by default, pairing auth, sandbox isolation, and least privilege.

## Page Guide

**Who this page is for**

- Operators hardening a local or tunneled NullClaw deployment
- Reviewers checking whether config or runtime changes widen trust boundaries
- Contributors touching gateway, tool, sandbox, or exposure-sensitive paths

**Read this next**

- Open [Configuration](./configuration.md) when you need the exact keys behind the controls summarized here
- Open [Gateway API](./gateway-api.md) if your security review includes pairing, bearer tokens, or webhooks
- Open [Usage and Operations](./usage.md) for day-to-day checks after a security-related config change

**If you came from ...**

- [Usage and Operations](./usage.md): this page explains the hardening context behind gateway and service recommendations
- [Configuration](./configuration.md): come here when a config key has security impact and needs policy-level interpretation
- [Architecture](./architecture.md): return here if a subsystem design decision crosses a security-sensitive boundary

## Baseline Controls

| Item | Status | How |
|---|---|---|
| Gateway not publicly exposed by default | Enabled | Defaults to `127.0.0.1`; refuses public bind without tunnel/explicit override |
| Pairing required | Enabled | One-time 6-digit pairing code, exchanged via `POST /pair` |
| Filesystem scope limits | Enabled | `workspace_only = true` by default |
| Tunnel-aware exposure | Enabled | Public access expected via Tailscale/Cloudflare/ngrok/custom tunnel |
| Sandbox isolation | Enabled | Auto-selects Landlock/Firejail/Bubblewrap/Docker |
| Secret encryption | Enabled | Credentials encrypted at rest with ChaCha20-Poly1305 |
| Resource limits | Enabled | Configurable memory/CPU/subprocess limits |
| Audit logging | Enabled | Optional audit trail with retention policy |

## Channel Allowlists

- `allow_from` behavior is channel-specific; do not assume `[]` is a deny-by-default switch across every runtime.
- Some channels, including WeChat and Discord, treat an omitted or empty `allow_from` as "no filtering", so set explicit user IDs/OpenIDs when you want a private bot.
- `allow_from: ["*"]`: allow all sources (high-risk).
- Otherwise: expect exact-match allowlists or channel-specific fallback/group-policy behavior.

## Pairing and Webhook Auth Boundaries

- `/pair` is POST-only and expects `X-Pairing-Code`.
- Repeated invalid pairing attempts can trigger rate limiting and a temporary lockout.
- `/.well-known/agent.json` and `/.well-known/agent-card.json` are public discovery documents when A2A is enabled.
- Keeping `gateway.require_pairing = true` keeps `/webhook` and `/a2a` behind bearer auth; disabling pairing removes that bearer check.
- Channel-specific inbound webhooks keep their own auth or signature rules and should not be documented as if they all use gateway bearer auth.

## Nostr-specific Rules

- `owner_pubkey` is always allowed even if `dm_allowed_pubkeys` is stricter.
- Private keys are stored encrypted (`enc2:`), decrypted in memory only while the channel runs.

## Recommended Security Config

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 3000,
    "require_pairing": true,
    "allow_public_bind": false
  },
  "autonomy": {
    "level": "supervised",
    "workspace_only": true,
    "max_actions_per_hour": 20
  },
  "security": {
    "sandbox": { "backend": "auto" },
    "audit": { "enabled": true, "retention_days": 90 }
  }
}
```

## Shell Environment Variables

By default, only a minimal set of safe environment variables (`PATH`, `HOME`, `TERM`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, `USER`, `SHELL`, `TMPDIR`) are passed to shell child processes. This prevents leaking API keys and credentials (CWE-200).

### Path-validated Environment Variables

Some deployments inject tools via volume mounts (e.g., a toolbox init container in Kubernetes). These tools may need environment variables like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to find shared libraries, but passing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` unconditionally is a security risk (library injection).

The `tools.path_env_vars` config allows specifying environment variables whose **values are platform path lists** (`:` on Unix, `;` on Windows). Each path component is validated against the sandbox before the variable is passed to child processes:

1. Every component must be an absolute path
2. Every component is resolved via `realpath` (canonicalized, symlinks followed)
3. Every component must be within the workspace or `allowed_paths`
4. The system blocklist (`/etc`, `/usr/lib`, `/bin`, etc.) always rejects

If **any** component fails validation, the entire variable is dropped.

```json
{
  "autonomy": {
    "allowed_paths": ["/opt/tools"]
  },
  "tools": {
    "path_env_vars": ["LD_LIBRARY_PATH", "PYTHONHOME", "NODE_PATH"]
  }
}
```

With the config above and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/tools/usr/lib:/opt/tools/lib` set in the container environment, the shell tool will validate both path components against `/opt/tools` (via `allowed_paths`) and pass the variable through. An attacker-controlled value like `/tmp/evil:/opt/tools/lib` would be rejected because `/tmp/evil` is not within the workspace or allowed paths.

## High-risk Settings

These settings significantly widen trust boundaries and should be used only in controlled environments:

- `autonomy.level = "full"`
- `autonomy.level = "yolo"`
- `allowed_commands = ["*"]`
- `allowed_paths = ["*"]`
- `gateway.allow_public_bind = true`

## Next Steps

- Review [Configuration](./configuration.md) before applying any high-risk setting listed on this page
- Use [Gateway API](./gateway-api.md) when you need endpoint-level auth and exposure details
- Run the checks in [Usage and Operations](./usage.md) after changing gateway, channel, or autonomy settings
