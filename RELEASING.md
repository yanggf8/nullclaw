# Releasing

NullClaw uses [CalVer](https://calver.org/) with the format `YYYY.M.D` (e.g., `v2026.3.12`).

Pushing a tag matching `v*` triggers the [Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml), which calls the shared `nullclaw/nullbuilder` Zig release workflow. It builds binaries for all supported platforms and publishes a GitHub Release.

## Nightly builds

The [Nightly workflow](.github/workflows/nightly.yml) runs at `02:23 UTC` every day and can also be started manually from GitHub Actions. It delegates the build matrix and artifact packaging to `nullclaw/nullbuilder`.

Nightly builds:

- build `ReleaseSmall` binaries for the same target matrix as releases
- upload per-target artifacts with SHA-256 files and a small JSON manifest
- keep artifacts for 14 days
- do not create GitHub Releases, move tags, or publish Docker images
- skip scheduled duplicate work when the current `main` commit already has a successful nightly run

Use the manual `force` input if you need to rebuild the same commit intentionally.

## Steps

1. **Checkout and update `main`**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a release branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/vYYYY.M.D
   ```

3. **Bump the version in `build.zig.zon`**

   Update the `.version` field to match today's date:

   ```diff
   - .version = "2026.3.11",
   + .version = "2026.3.12",
   ```

4. **Commit the version bump**

   ```bash
   git add build.zig.zon
   git commit -m "vYYYY.M.D"
   ```

5. **Tag and push the branch**

   ```bash
   git tag vYYYY.M.D
   git push origin release/vYYYY.M.D --tags
   ```

   The tag push triggers CI builds. If builds fail, fix on the branch, move the tag, and push again:

   ```bash
   # after fixing and committing:
   git tag -f vYYYY.M.D
   git push origin release/vYYYY.M.D --tags --force
   ```

6. **Create a PR once builds pass**

   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "vYYYY.M.D" --body "Version bump for vYYYY.M.D release."
   ```

7. **Merge the PR** (or get it reviewed and merged)

## Notes

- The tag is created on the release branch so CI builds run before merging to `main`. This avoids having to push fixes directly to `main` if builds fail.
- If multiple releases happen on the same day, append a patch number (e.g., `v2026.3.12.1`), though this should be rare.
- NullHub follows the same versioning and release process. Both repos should be released together with matching version numbers.
